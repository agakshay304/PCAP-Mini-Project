# iFilter

iFilter is a CUDA-based image processing project that allows users to apply various filters to their images. With iFilter, you can convert your images to black and white, sepia, or apply a Gaussian blur. Additionally, you can invert the colors of your image to create a unique effect. This project is designed to take advantage of the power of CUDA-enabled GPUs to provide fast and efficient image processing.

## Installation

To use iFilter, you will need to have a CUDA-enabled GPU and the CUDA toolkit installed on your system. Once you have the necessary dependencies, you can clone this repository and build the project. 


## Usage

To use iFilter, simply run the binary with the desired input image and filter option:

Filter options are as follows:

- `1` : Colour Inversion
- `2` : Gaussian Blur
- `3` : Adjust Contrast
- `4` : Adjust Brightness
